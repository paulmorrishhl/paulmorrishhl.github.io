### About TestedTruths

First and foremost, this is a space dedicated to the beautiful artform of software testing. I'm passionate about testing software and working with cross-functional teams to build, test, and release complex software that is made magically simple through an intuitive and well-designed user-experience.

This space will contain experienced insights, tool overviews, personal anecdotes, step-by-step tutorials, and a lot more. 

### So, Who Am I?

My name is Paul Morris, based in the United Kingdom. I've built software for some of the world'a largest companies (primarily native mobile applications) but my passion was always testing. I've led global testing teams, worked solo on huge projects and small startups, and everything inbetween. 

I'm currently the QA Lead for one of the UK's most successful startups and am handson with all types of testing as well as mentoring, leadership, and documetation on a daily basis.

I have walked what you might call an unconventional path to get the career that I have now. I've designed renewable electrical services for large buildings, specialised in mathmatical lighting calculations for hospitals and public service buildings, founded and exited my own app consultancy, ran an engineering team for one of the world's most highly-rated app consultancies, and currently have the pleasure of helping companies all over the globe master their team's time.
